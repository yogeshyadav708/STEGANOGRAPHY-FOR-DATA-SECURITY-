# STEGANOGRAPHY-FOR-DATA-SECURITY-
Steganography hides secret data within digital media so its existence remains unnoticed. This project explores image, video, and image-in-image steganography using LSB and frame-based methods. It evaluates imperceptibility, robustness, and capacity, integrates encryption for security, and discusses applications, ethics, and limitations.
